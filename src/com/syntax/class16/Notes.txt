There are three types of variables with respect to their scope

Local Variables:
    if a variable is created inside a block of codel ike a method, loop,
    if condition etc. they are called local variables

    Upside:
        Local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time. You should
        always try to write code with the help of local variables.

    Downside:
        They can't be accessed outside the lbock in which they are created.
        They have very limited scope.

Instance Variables:
    All the variables which are created inside a class but outside of methods
    are called instance variables

    Upside:
    we can use them in all the instance methods of that class. Their scope is larger
    than local variables.

    Downside:
    They stay longer in the memory as compared
