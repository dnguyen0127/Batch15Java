2D Arrays:
    Are arrays that contain 1D arrays.

  Why we should learn about 2D arrays.
    Because they allow us to stmore muiltiple one d arrays which giv us more flexibility
    to store data.

    for example if we have to store data from excel files we can use 2d arrays.

    Syntax to create 2d arrays:

    First way:
        DataType[][] nameOfArray= new DataType[SizeOf Rows][];

    Second way:
        DataType[][] nameOfArray= {{data,data,data},{data,data,data},{data,data,data}};
